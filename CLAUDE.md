# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **Claude Code Toolkit v2.1.0** - a toolkit for Claude Code that provides **18 specialized commands** and **12 intelligent agents** with **comprehensive standards system integration** and **dual-scope installation architecture** for automated workflow orchestration and developer productivity.

## Core Architecture

### Component Structure
- **`/commands/`**: 18 Claude Code commands (.md files) that implement specific automation workflows
- **`/agents/`**: 12 specialized M1 agents for delegation and orchestration
- **`/standards/`**: **13 YAML files** containing technology-specific coding standards with auto-detection fallback
- **`/scripts/`**: Python monitoring scripts for status line integration
- **`/testing/`**: QUICK-TESTS.md system for 30-second validation of all commands
- **`/docs/`**: User documentation including CHEAT-SHEET.md and USER-GUIDE.md

### Standards System (COMPLETELY RECONSTRUCTED)
The toolkit uses a **massively overhauled standards system** with `standards/{detected-stack}.yaml || standards/general.yaml` fallback:
- **Commands**: All 18 commands automatically load appropriate standards based on detected technology stack
- **Agents**: All 12 M1 agents now integrate standards system with strategic positioning in critical agents
- **13 technology-specific YAML files**: Angular, FastAPI, HTML5, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, React, TypeScript, Vue, MCP, **Java, Spring Boot**, plus general
- **Research-driven content**: All standards updated with 2024-2025 best practices using ULTRATHINK methodology
- **Ultra-critical agents**: M1-qa-gatekeeper (FIRST PRIORITY) and M1-ultrathink-orchestrator (CRITICAL FIRST STEP) have maximum standards visibility
- **Quality transformation**: 4,000+ → 1,343 lines (67% reduction) while maintaining functionality

### Command Types
- **A-commands**: Planning, management, and orchestration (A-plan, A-ai-code, A-workflow, etc.)
- **B-commands**: Tools and analysis (B-create-feature, B-explain-code, B-debug-error, etc.)
- **M1-agents**: Specialized delegation targets for complex workflows

## Key Development Commands
