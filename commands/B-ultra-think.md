# B-Ultra Think - Deep Analysis Framework

Load standards/{detected-stack}.yaml || standards/general.yaml as fallback for analysis standards.

An치lisis sistem치tico multi-perspectiva para problemas complejos: $ARGUMENTS

## Context Detection
- Root: !`git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd`
- Stack detection: !`find . -name "package.json" -o -name "requirements.txt" -o -name "pom.xml" -o -name "Cargo.toml" -o -name "*.sln" | head -3`
- Recent activity: !`git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null || echo "No git history"`

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Problem Decomposition
- Extract core challenge from: $ARGUMENTS
- Identify constraints and dependencies
- Map known variables and unknowns
- Define success criteria

### 2. Multi-Perspective Analysis

#### Technical Perspective
- Implementation feasibility with current stack
- Performance and scalability implications
- Security and maintenance considerations
- Integration complexity

#### Business Perspective
- Cost/benefit analysis
- Timeline and resource requirements
- Risk assessment
- Strategic alignment

#### User Perspective
- Impact on user experience
- Adoption challenges
- Training requirements
- Support implications

#### Standards Perspective
- Compliance with team/industry standards
- Code quality impact
- Long-term maintainability
- Documentation requirements

### 3. Solution Generation

#### Conventional Approach
- Industry best practices
- Framework-specific patterns
- Proven implementations
- Low-risk solutions

#### Creative Approach
- Cross-domain analogies
- Novel combinations
- Unconventional methods
- High-potential solutions

#### Hybrid Approach

- Phased implementations
- Risk-balanced solutions
- Iterative improvements

### 4. Impact Analysis

#### Immediate Effects
- Direct consequences
- Resource consumption
- Performance impact
- User disruption

#### Secondary Effects
- Team workflow changes
- System interactions
- Maintenance overhead
- Scaling implications

#### Long-term Effects
- Technical debt impact
- Evolution flexibility
- Knowledge transfer
- Strategic positioning
